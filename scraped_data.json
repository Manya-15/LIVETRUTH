All the major retailers are currently showing \"sold out.\" Even if you were online when preorders went live, there's a good chance you wouldn't have been able to score one. In other words, it was kind of a [mess](https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-went-live-and-were-predictably-a-mess).\n\nSo what are your current options for getting one at this point? It's possible a retailer will get more preorder stock, so follow [IGN Deals on X](https://x.com/IGNDeals) and [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:u3vrjw2x6cirefropafy3gu5) for real-time updates. If you meet certain conditions (you've been a Nintendo Switch Online member for at least 12 months and have logged over 50 hours of Switch play time prior to April 2 of this year), you can [register your interest](https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/how-to-buy/) to have a chance to buy a Switch 2 directly from Nintendo. Emails with buy links will go out to select customers starting May 8.\n\nIf you did manage to preorder a Switch 2, be sure to check out all the [Switch 2 games available for preorder](https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-game-preorder-guide). And a new console is a lot more fun with peripherals, so also check out where to [preorder Switch 2 accessories](https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-nintendo-switch-2-official-accessories).\n\n## Switch 2 Preorder Times at a Glance\n\n[![undefined](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/16/screenshot-161-1737034377908.png?fit=bounds\u0026width=1280\u0026height=720)](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/16/screenshot-161-1737034377908.png)\n\n- [**Walmart**](https://zdcs.link/9yXJn6?object_uuid=b2826c2f-4740-4a4f-a932-66eddbee1d9a\u0026t=article) \\- 12 a.m. ET April 24\n- [**Best Buy**](https://zdcs.link/9Z5YnD?object_uuid=b2826c2f-4740-4a4f-a932-66eddbee1d9a\u0026t=article)\\- 12 a.m. ET April 24\n- [**Target**](https://zdcs.link/QWwVON?object_uuid=b2826c2f-4740-4a4f-a932-66eddbee1d9a\u0026t=article) \\- 12 a.m. ET April 24\n- [**GameStop**](https://zdcs.link/924YRW?object_uuid=b2826c2f-4740-4a4f-a932-66eddbee1d9a\u0026t=article) \\- 11 a.m. ET April 24\n\nIf you're in a hurry and you don't have time for details, the above list has links and times Switch 2 preorders go live online at all the major retailers.

Walmart has offered no information about placing preorders live and in person at one of its retail locations.\n\nHowever, Walmart is the **only retailer offering free delivery of your Switch 2 console by 9 a.m. on launch day, June 5**. So that’s pretty cool.\n\n## Best Buy: Switch 2 Preorders\n\n[![See at Best Buy](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/01/best-buy-logo-1743510102376.png?width=220\u0026auto=webp)](https://zdcs.link/znXRN3?object_uuid=b2826c2f-4740-4a4f-a932-66eddbee1d9a\u0026t=article \"See at Best Buy\")\n\n### See at Best Buy\n\n8\n\n[$449.99 at Best Buy](https://zdcs.link/znXRN3?object_uuid=b2826c2f-4740-4a4f-a932-66eddbee1d9a\u0026t=article)\n\n- [**Preorder here**](https://zdcs.link/9Z5YnD?object_uuid=b2826c2f-4740-4a4f-a932-66eddbee1d9a\u0026t=article) **starting at 12 a.m. ET April 24**\n\nBest Buy also began taking online preorders for the Nintendo Switch 2, games, and accessories at 12 a.m. ET on April 24. Additionally, most Best Buy stores will open at midnight on June 5 for customers to pick up their preorders, if that’s the option you select when you place your preorder.\n\n## Are you going to pick up your Switch 2 at midnight?\n\nOf course!\n\nNo way!\n\nI don't have a Best Buy anywhere near me.\n\nAnswerSee ResultsSee Results\n\n## Target: Switch 2 Preorders\n\n[![See at Target](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/01/images-3-1743509934466.jfif?width=220\u0026auto=webp)](https://zdcs.link/QWwVON?object_uuid=b2826c2f-4740-4a4f-a932-66eddbee1d9a\u0026t=article \"See at Target\")\n\n### See at Target\n\n7\n\n[$449.99 at Target](https://zdcs.link/QWwVON?object_uuid=b2826c2f-4740-4a4f-a932-66eddbee1d9a\u0026t=article)\n\n- [**Preorder here**](https://zdcs.link/QWwVON?object_uuid=b2826c2f-4740-4a4f-a932-66eddbee1d9a\u0026t=article) **starting at 12 a.m. ET April 24**\n\nPreorders at Target for the console, games, and accessories went live at midnight, early April 24. You’ll be able to preorder online. The company hasn’t mentioned if preorders will be available in-store.\n\n## GameStop: Switch 2 Preorders\n\n[![See at GameStop](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/01/gamestop-logo-1743510251117.png?width=220\u0026auto=webp)](https://zdcs.link/QrXk1G?object_uuid=b2826c2f-4740-4a4f-a932-66eddbee1d9a\u0026t=article \"See at GameStop\")\n\n### See at GameStop\n\n5\n\n[$449.99 at GameStop](https://zdcs.link/QrXk1G?object_uuid=b2826c2f-4740-4a4f-a932-66eddbee1d9a\u0026t=article)\n\n- [**Preorder here**](https://zdcs.link/924YRW?object_uuid=b2826c2f-4740-4a4f-a932-66eddbee1d9a\u0026t=article) **starting at 11 a.m. ET April 24**\n\nGameStop is kicking off preorders later than any of the other major retailers. Online preorders start at 11 a.m. ET on April 24, a full 11 hours after they start at the above retailers.\n\nYou can also preorder in person at brick-and-mortar GameStop locations when the stores open on April 24. As for preorder pickup, all GameStop stores will be open for at midnight on June 5 so you can be among the first to get your new console.\n\n## Nintendo Store: Switch 2 Preorders\n\n[![See at Nintendo Store](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/22/nintendo-logo-1745347216159.jpg?width=220\u0026auto=webp)](https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/how-to-buy/ \"See at Nintendo Store\")\n\n### See at Nintendo Store\n\n11\n\n[$449.99 at Nintendo Store](https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/how-to-buy/)\n\nPreorders from the official Nintendo Store are a bit more complicated than at the retailers above. First, you’ll need to [visit this page](https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/how-to-buy/), log into your Nintendo account, and register your interest by selecting either the console by itself or in a bundle with Mario Kart World.\n\nOnce you do that, Nintendo will send you an email when it’s your turn to complete the purchase. The first batch of invitations will go out on May 8. When you receive your email invitation, you’ll have 72 hours to complete your purchase.\n\nThere are a number of caveats for buying a Switch 2 this way, however. It’s only open to customers “who have purchased a Nintendo Switch Online membership with a minimum of 12 months of paid membership and a minimum of 50 total gameplay hours, as of April 2, 2025.” If you don’t qualify for that, you’ll need to make your purchase elsewhere.\n\nAlso be sure to check out [how to increase your chances of preordering a Switch 2](https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-tips-for-successfully-preordering-in-2025).\n\n_Chris Reed is a deals expert and commerce editor for IGN.
